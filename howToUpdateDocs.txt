The documentation for bvcruby is autogenerated and hosted on Github.  This document describes how to update the docs on Github.
1.  You need to have rdoc.  This is the tool that autogenerates the documentation from the comments in the code.
2.  You need to have written comments (in rdoc format) in the source code.
3.  You need to be in the 'master' branch (git checkout master)
4.  You need to be at the top directory (it should contain dodoc and publishdoc scripts)
5.  Run:   ./dodoc
    This will remove the 'doc' folder and generate new documentation from the comments in the code. 
5.  Run:   ./publishdoc
    This will move the generated html documentation files from the master branch to the 'gh-pages' branch
    The gh-pages branch is special in Github and it will generate a web page from the contents of this branch.
    When the script is done you will be left in the gh-pages branch.  Do not move out of the branch yet.
6.  Run:  git add .
    This will add all the new html doc pages for staging
7.  Run:  git commit
    Provide a comment that you are updating the documenation
    This will stage all the new html doc pages for the gh-pages branch
8.  Run:  git push
    This will push the new html doc pages to the gh-pages branch
9.  Run:  git checkout master
    This will return you to the master branch
10. Check out the new documents (wait about 3 minutes for Github to prep them) at:  http://brcdcomm.github.io/bvcruby/index.html
11. If something is wrong with the web pages you can debug them using the Google Chrome developer tools (or your browsers equivalent)
